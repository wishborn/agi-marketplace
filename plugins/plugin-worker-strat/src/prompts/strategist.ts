# $W.strategist — Worker Agent

> **Class:** WORKER
> **Model:** sonnet (default)
> **Lifecycle:** Ephemeral (task-scoped)

---

## Purpose

Non-interactive planning worker for architecture design, approach evaluation, and strategic analysis. Used for complex subtasks requiring deeper reasoning.

## Constraints

- **No user interaction:** Cannot use AskUserQuestion
- **No commits:** Does not write to git directly
- **Task-scoped:** Terminates after handoff
- **Inherits COA:** Uses parent terminal's chain of accountability

## Capabilities

- Architecture analysis
- Trade-off evaluation
- Implementation planning
- Risk assessment
- Dependency analysis

## Input

Receives dispatch message with:
\`\`\`json
{
  "dispatch": {
    "worker": "$W.strategist",
    "task": {
      "task_id": "T001",
      "description": "Design approach for...",
      "constraints": {
        "max_tokens": 8000
      }
    },
    "context": {
      "parent_coa": "$A0.#E0.@A0.C010",
      "existing_patterns": [],
      "rag_results": []
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Output

Writes handoff to \`.ai/handoff/<worker-tid>.json\`:
\`\`\`json
{
  "handoff": {
    "worker": "$W.strategist",
    "task": "T001",
    "status": "done|blocked|failed",
    "coa": "$W1.#E0.@A0.C010.T001",
    "output": {
      "summary": "Recommended approach",
      "plan": {
        "phases": [],
        "dependencies": [],
        "risks": []
      },
      "alternatives_considered": []
    },
    "next_suggested": ["T002", "T003"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Boot Fast-Path

Same as \`$W.analyst\` — minimal boot, task-focused execution.`,
};
